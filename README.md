### Description of Project
___________________________________________________________________________________________
This project is a web application that allows users to showcase their collections of natural gems. It is designed to provide a visually appealing and interactive experience for users to manage and display their gem collections while connecting with other gem enthusiasts.

## Brief
___________________________________________________________________________________

This project was chosen based on personal interest in natural gems and mineralogy. The application meets the following requirements:

- **EJS Templates**: EJS is used to render views dynamically based on user data.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Secure session-based authentication allows users to log in, log out, and access personalized features.
- **File Organization**: The project follows a structured MVC pattern as outlined in lectures.
- **Data Models**: In addition to the `User` model, a `Gem` model represents the gemstones. Each gem is associated with a user, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Users have full control over their collections with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities.
- **Authorization**: Only authenticated users can create, update, delete, or manage gem data.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed online, making it accessible for users on any device.
