Brief
___________________________________________________________________________________
The type of application to build was entirely up to us and we were encouraged to choose something of personal interest to us. The following minimum requirements were to be met:

The app must utilize EJS templates to render views to users.

The app must use session based authentication.

The app's files must be organized according to the conventions taught in our lectures.

The app must have at least one data entity in addition to the User model and at least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.

The app must have full CRUD functionality.

Authorization must be implemented in the app. Guests who are not signed in must not be able to create, update or delete data or access functionality allowing those actions.

The app must be deployed online.
